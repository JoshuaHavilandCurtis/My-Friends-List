Simple My Friends VueJS Application 


### Running the Code

- Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This
will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise (it's not in the attachment
because that would bloat the ZIP file)
- Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080
(or whichever port is shown in your terminal)

### Functionality

- Delete
- Add
